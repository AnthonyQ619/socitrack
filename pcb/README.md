PolyPoint Hardware
==================

The PolyPoint system consists of several PCBs centered around TriPoint,
the core UWB ranging module.

1. **TriPoint**: Triangular module which contains all necessary hardware
for using the DecaWave DW1000. It has castellated headers so it can be
soldered onto a carrier board to add indoor localization functionality
to any device.

2. **TriTag**: Portable carrier board designed to be used as an indoor
localization tag.
