TotTag Overview
===============

TotTag is a wearable platform for social interaction tracking. The project grew
out of a MSc thesis in collaboration with Lab11 (Prof. Prabal Dutta) at the
University of California, Berkeley, and the Computer Engineering Group (Prof.
Lothar Thiele) at ETH Zurich. The project thesis is available under
[this link](https://pub.tik.ee.ethz.ch/students/2018-HS/MA-2018-36.pdf).


Documentation
-------------

Here you can find detailed documentation on how to get started using the TotTag.

If you find errors or think something could be made clearer, please go ahead
and submit an edit to the documentation directly (small pencil icon in the
upper-right corner). If there is a more substantial question, please
[create a new issue](https://github.com/lab11/socitrack/issues) so we can keep
track of it and fix it.
