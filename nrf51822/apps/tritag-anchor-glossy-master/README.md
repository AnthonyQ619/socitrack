Anchor BLE Application for TriTag
=================================

This app run on TriTag but puts it in anchor mode. On boot, the app sends the I2C commands
to put the TriPoint module into anchor mode, and doesn't do much else.

It is designed to be a stop-gap before we have dedicated anchor hardware.
